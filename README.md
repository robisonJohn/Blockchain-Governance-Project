# Introduction
In the prior round of modeling governance data, we attempted to use multiple linear regression to determine whether or not there was a meaningful relationship between governance variables and the corresponding ICO size. There were many problems with this approach; however, the most salient problem was that we were comparing categorical variables (governance type, determined qualitatively) against numerical values (ICO Size, Value Creation, Market Cap). See the attached Google Colab for the data categorization and visualization. See the attached documents in R to examine the results of linear regression using a discrete approach (instead of a continuous approach).
