In the prior round of modeling governance data, we attempted to use multiple linear regression to determine whether or not there was a meaningful relationship between governance variables and the corresponding ICO size. There were many problems with this approach; however, the most salient problem was that we were comparing categorical variables (governance type, determined qualitatively) against numerical values (ICO Size, Value Creation, Market Cap). In addition, we attempted to use multiple regression models, which may have introduced confounding variables. In this research (found in the above Google Colab), we reorganize the data and chart the frequencies of given components of each governance variable. The purpose of this exerciseis to determine which
